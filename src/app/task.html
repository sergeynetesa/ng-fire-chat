    <h3>Overview</h3>
    This is a test app to prove technical skill in <strong>Web UI</strong> and <strong>Firebase / Firestore</strong>.<br />
    We want to build a simple <u>one-to-many</u> <strong>chat interface</strong>. 
    In this case we have many <strong>end users</strong> and <strong>1 support person</strong> who chats with them, a <strong>Therapist</strong>.
    The <strong>users</strong> and <strong>chat data</strong> are <u>all</u> stored in <strong>Firestore</strong>. 
    <u>All</u> chat data should be loaded from <b>Firestore</b>.<br />
    <u>All</u> updates to <b>users</b> and <b>chat text</b> should be tracked with a 
    <b>document</b> or <b>collection snapshot listener</b> (see https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/listen)
    
    <h3>Screen</h3>
    There is 1 screen with 3 main sections.    
    <p><img alt="" src="../assets/img/test_app_files/image001.jpg" /></p>

    <h3>Section 1</h3>
    This is the Current User chat. It shows:
    The name of the current user (e.g. User 2). This should update when a new user is selected. 
    The chat history. These should be loaded from Firestore and kept up to date using snapshot listeners.
    The text field for a new message. The ôUser Sendö button. When the send button is pressed, the text in the text field is saved to Firestore and the text field cleared. 
    Text is saved to the document
    /users/<UUID>/messages/<YYYY-MM-DD> a new field is saved for each text message. The field is a map with two entries ôsourceö:ôuserö and ôtextö:<message text> in addition the current timestamp is save to the document /users/<UUID> to the field ôuser_msgö
    
    Section 2
    This is the Therapist chat. It shows: 
    A fixed name (e.g. Therapist). 
    The chat history. These should be loaded from Firestore and kept up to date using snapshot listeners.
    The text field for a new message.
    ôTherapist Sendö button. When the send button is pressed, the text in the text field is saved to Firestore and the text field cleared. Text is saved to the document /users/<UUID>/messages/<YYYY-MM-DD> a new field is saved for each text message. The field is a map with two entries
    ôsourceö:ôtherapistö and ôtextö:<message text> in addition the current timestamp is save to the document /users/<UUID> to the field ôtherapist_msgö
    
    Section 3
    This shows:
    The User Selection List. This allows selection of the current user. It also displays if there are unread messages form the user or therapist. A message is unread if the ôuser_msgö timestamp != the ôtherapist_msgö timestamp.
    A ôCreate Userö button when pressed it adds a new user to Firestore and the User List should update using a snapshot listener. New users are added to /users/<UUID> with the fields ônameö:String , ôtherapist_msgö:Timestamp and ôuser_msgö:Timestamp set.
    A ôMark Readö button. When pressed this button with set the current users ôtherapist_msgö field equal to the ôuser_msgö field. The newer of the two timestamps should used.
    
    Firebase
    You should start form an empty Firestore and build up the following structure:
    * Users (collection)
    o <UUID> (document)
    * name : String (field)
    * therapists_msg : Timestamp (field)
    * user_msg : Timestamp (field)
    * messages (collection)
    * <YYYY-MM-DD> (document)
    o HHMMSS.sss : Map (field)
    * source : String (map field)
    * text : String (map field)
    NOTE: you only need to display the current dayÆs chat text.
    
    The following images show the Firebase Firestore for the demo screen shown above.
